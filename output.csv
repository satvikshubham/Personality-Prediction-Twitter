0,"@thesheetztweetz @QuiltyAnalytics First Starship orbital flight will be with Raptor 2 engines, as they are much more capable &amp; reliable. 230 ton or ~500k lb thrust at sea level.

Weâ€™ll have 39 flightworthy engines built by next month, then another month to integrate, so hopefully May for orbital flight test.|||@thesheetztweetz @QuiltyAnalytics SpaceX default plan was ~65% of global launch mass to orbit this year. Incremental demand might take that to ~70%, so not a major change. Those numbers donâ€™t count Starship.

Rough math is ~16 tons * 50 launches = 800 tons. Rest of world is &lt;400 tons (mostly China).|||@DivesTech Makes a huge difference to capital efficiency to localize production within a continent|||Excited to hand over the first production cars made by Giga Berlin-Brandenburg tomorrow!|||@BillyM2k Ok, maybe I should play League then|||@DoctorJack16 Main Tesla subjects will be scaling to extreme size, which is needed to shift humanity away from fossil fuels, and AI.

That was mega pain.|||@PaperBagInvest But reaching volume production with sustained positive cash flow was last achieved by an American car company, Chrysler, ~100 years ago!

Ford &amp; Tesla are the only American car companies to avoid bankruptcy. Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009.|||@PaperBagInvest Prototypes are easy, production is hard. 

Making an electric car was not the hard part of Tesla â€“ dozens of companies have done that.|||RT @SpaceX: Starship full stack propellant load testing at Starbase https://t.co/CFW7E51qdI|||@MrManderly @mysteriouskat @Independent @rustyrockets Good point. Politicians &amp; political parties should be supported on their merits, not like they are oneâ€™s favorite sports team.|||@Independent With so many mainstream media companies saying @rustyrockets is crazy/dangerous, I watched some of his videos. Ironically, he seemed more balanced &amp; insightful than those condemning him!

The groupthink among major media companies is more troubling. There should be more dissent.|||@WholeMarsBlog FSD releasing to Canada next week|||@Rainmaker1973 Yeah :)|||I have so much respect for the associates doing an honest dayâ€™s work at Tesla or SpaceX building &amp; servicing cars, rockets, Starlinks, batteries, solar &amp; many other things|||Working hard to make useful products &amp; services for your fellow humans is deeply morally good|||Working on Master Plan Part 3|||@WholeMarsBlog Took us way too long|||@wowsuchcurrency True, I do support the current thing haha!|||@pmarca Yeah|||@engineers_feed Hardcore|||@WholeMarsBlog They have no idea how hard FSD is. Only path to success imo is hardcore real-world AI software with dedicated NN inference acceleration ASICs in car, multibillion dollar NN training supercluster and 10+ billion miles of vehicle data. Good luck.|||Thank you for the offer, but such excellent training would give me too much of an advantage. 

If he is afraid to fight, I will agree to use only my left hand and I am not even left-handed.
